After a break of two weeks, it will be business as usual for the National First Division League teams this weekend.Black Leopards are leaving no stone unturned in their preparations for their all-important match against Cape Town All Stars. They will meet at the Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow (Saturday) afternoon.While a victory for Black Leopards will enhance their chances of brining the league title to Thohoyandou at the end of the season, it is a matter of life and death for the team from&nbsp;the Mother City. They are perched in the sixth spot from the bottom of the log and not safe when it comes to relegation. They have deposited 24 points into their account to date, nine more than the tail-enders, Santos FC.&nbsp;Should they fail to collect the maximum points tomorrow, Leopards are likely&nbsp; to drop from the second to the fifth&nbsp;spot on the log, depending on the results for the other league title contenders, Royal Eagles, Stellenbosch FC and Jomo Cosmos.Leopards will pin their hopes on Mwape Musonda, Ivan Mahangwahaya, Leonard Ntshangase and Mziwokuthula Zimu for goals, while Lebohang Mabotja, Marks Munyai and Thivhavhudzi Ndou will keep their danger area clean.The University of Pretoria will host Mbombela United at the Tuks Stadium in Pretoria. The Amatuks are one of the league title contenders, while Mbombela are out of the race. The pace setters, Thanda Royal Zulu, will fly to Cape Town to honour their fixture against Milano United at the Athlone Stadium, and Royal Eagles will entertain FC Cape Town at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg.Mthatha Bucks and Real Kings will meet at the Mthatha Stadium and Santos will host Magezi FC at the Athlone Stadium in Cape Town on Sunday.
