He hails from Masia village, where he also attends school. To him music is part of his soul and triggers a sensation of fulfilment each time he starts rapping.&ldquo;Many people are too quick to judge. Mostly I hear people telling me that I am too young and that I should only focus on my school work. In response, I usually just say that not everyone can be a lawyer, doctor or even a teacher as this is what society expects. And what if I can do both? Would that not be a greater success?&rdquo;Hiccups started rapping in 2009. &ldquo;I used to listen to Western rap music quite a lot, and each time I listened I just felt like there&rsquo;s something I could add to the lyrics. Since then I realized my passion for music and I started writing my own songs,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Hiccups. He says that the songs he writes give him an opportunity to express what is buried deep in his soul.Hiccups does not only want to be recognized as a local rapper, he wants to be recognized internationally, because he believes that his music accommodates everyone and has the potential to be loved and enjoyed by both the young and the old.&ldquo;I have not released any albums due to a lack of funding. I do, however, plan on releasing a mix-tape version which is called &lsquo;grind and shine&rsquo;. I believe this will help me to gain recognition in higher places,&rdquo; Hiccups adds. He says the mix-tape is titled &lsquo;grind and shine&rsquo; because &quot;when you work hard, you eventually shine&quot;.Weekends and school holidays are the only times Hiccup currently has for music. &ldquo;On school days I do school work, and on weekends and school holidays I focus on my music. Life is too short to deny your talents and abilities,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;I am only available on weekends for bookings and can be contacted via email at thinatitus@gmail.com,&rdquo; says Hiccups.&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow Hiccups on:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
