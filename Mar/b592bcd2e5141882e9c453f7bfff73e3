Three schools that obtained a 100% pass rate, Tshirululuni, Willmary and Swobani, were also acknowledged during the event. Sinthumule High was awarded a trophy and a certificate for producing the most bachelor passes.The Soutpansberg&nbsp;West&rsquo;s circuit manager, Ms Christina Ramovha, emphasized that it was important to acknowledge the various schools&rsquo; leadership, teachers and pupils. &ldquo;This ceremony serves as a motivation to our teachers and pupils. It is a way of recognising their good work during the past academic year.&rdquo;&ldquo;We hope to do better this year. Together, we as circuit administrators, school-governing bodies and parents&nbsp;should double our efforts to get the teachers fully committed to support learners,&rdquo; she said.The guest speaker at the event and also a circuit manager of Hlanganani North, Mr George Mathivha, told pupils how they had defeated the odds to become successful in life.&nbsp;He said the pupils could&nbsp;only succeed if they worked hard, planned well and remained focused. The role models&nbsp;included engineers, businessmen and medical doctors from rural villages around the area, and all had a similar story to tell.&nbsp;&ldquo;One can succeed despite one&rsquo;s background,&rdquo; he said.Mathivha encouraged the parents to cooperate with the Department of Education and other stakeholders for the benefit of education in the country. He said it was important to set realistic goals that could be achieved within a given period in life. &ldquo;Failure does not necessarily mean that one has to stop pursuing your dreams,&rdquo; he said.
