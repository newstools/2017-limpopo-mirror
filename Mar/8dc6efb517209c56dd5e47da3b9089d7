The struggle for promotion and to avoid relegation will continue among the affiliates of the Limpopo Stream of the ABC Motsepe League this weekend. Six matches will be played at the various places throughout the province tomorrow afternoon, while the remaining two will be staged on Sunday.Two of the three Vhembe-based sides, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) and Madridtas, will play their matches at home.TTM will entertain Polokwane United at the Tshifulanani Stadium tomorrow. Although they are in the third position on the log, TTM&rsquo;s chances of winning the league title are fast becoming slim. They are separated by a gap of 10 points from the pace setters, Bellevue Winners Park. Should Winners Park win their weekend match against Polokwane Academy, TTM must forget about winning the league title even if they beat Polokwane United by whatever margin.Madridtas will meet the Molemole Academy at the Tshifudi Stadium. Madridtas&rsquo; performance has been&nbsp;deteriorating with time. They donated numerous points to their opponents in their recent matches. Their result last weekend was a disappointing goalless draw against Mokopane Ratanang in Mokopane.The log leaders, Bellevue Winners Park, will enjoy the home-ground advantage in their match against Polokwane Academy at the Giyani Stadium. Polokwane Academy lost 0-1 to Bellevue in their first-round encounter. Gawula Classic will host Joe Maweja at the Giyani Stadium on Sunday.
