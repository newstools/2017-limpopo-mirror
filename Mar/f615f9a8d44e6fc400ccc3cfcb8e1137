Water shortages will hopefully&nbsp;be a thing of the past for the communities of Folovhodwe, Muswodi, Tshiungani and Masisi in the near future, thanks to the Luphephe Nwanedi Bulk Water Supply from Folovhodwe to Masisi.The media liaison officer of the Vhembe District Municipality, Mr Moss Shibambu, told Limpopo Mirror that the construction of the R160 million project, which began in October last year, will solve the problem of a scarcity of water in the affected areas.According to Shibambu, contractors have been working around the clock since December last year. &ldquo;We are ready to change the life of our communities for the better and as we are the water services authority, we will not rest until our communities get better services.&rdquo; He added that they were also liaising with the traditional leaders, councillors and community liaison officers of the affected areas, so that the water projects can be completed as soon as possible.A community liaison officer for Luphephe Nwanedi Bulk Water Supply, Mr Joseph Manenzhe, said that, during the construction phase, more than 20 previously unemployed people were now working, and &nbsp;thecommunities of Folovhodwe, Muswodi, and Tshiungani were among those people benefiting. He appealed to the communities, however, to stop vandalizing the material at the site. &ldquo;Stealing will move the construction of the project off its tracks,&rdquo; he added.According to Manenzhe, he was previously unemployed and was looking for a job, without any luck, but now things have changed for better&nbsp;because he can put food on the table for his family.&nbsp;
