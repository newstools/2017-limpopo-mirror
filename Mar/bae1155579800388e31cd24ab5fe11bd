The community of Vhembe has learnt with shock of the passing on of one of the area&#39;s best-known praise singers, Mr Prince Mphaphuli.Mphaphuli (53) passed away&nbsp;last week. He accompanied Thovhele Gole Mphaphuli, one of Limpopo&#39;s most senior traditional leaders, with 76 chiefs under him, to all his official duties. He was buried at Zwiendeulu zwa Mbilwi on Friday, 10 March, as per custom.To those well versed in the Venda culture would understandably know that he held a very commanding role and was credited with the successes of the Mphaphuli royalty. Though he had a full-time job as a petrol attendant at one of the garages in Sibasa, he was a common feature with&nbsp;Thovhele Gole Mphaphuli as praise singer&nbsp;before the traditional leader would deliver speeches at official events.He will be remembered for reciting old royal poems and his famous remarks like Tshizwa tsha tsikidzi, Lutiitii lu na dzhasi, Thindi ndia mila, Pfene li khou daha bibi, Tshizwa tsha nnda, and Voho la thunzi among others. Thovhele nga vha lalame, Tshidada Muhali, Danda la Musimbiri and Khakhamela became his trademark praises while Thovhele Mphaphuli addressed gatherings.His elder brother, Vho Khotsimunene Nkhumiseni Mphaphuli, described his death as a big loss to the Mphaphuli royalty. Chief Makwarela Makhuvha, one of the Mphaphuli inner circle&nbsp;who sometimes officiates on behalf of Thovhele Mphaphuli, said they were feeling his absence and the void left after his death.
