Tshakhuma RO United had mixed fortunes in their MMK Administrators League matches last weekend. They beat Beuster Mighty Chiefs 2-0 at the Tshakhuma Malaria grounds on Saturday and played to a goalless draw with Voweto Maximum Force at the Zwavhavhili grounds the following day.Their game on Sunday against Maximum Force was characterized by wasted scoring opportunities. The visitors from Tshakhuma realized that it was not their day nine minutes into the game. Their slender left winger, Takalani &ldquo;Franco&rdquo; Ratshilima, unleashed a volley from the 35-meter area. The ball hit the crossbar and bounced next to the goal line. The referee waved a play-on signal and thus stopped&nbsp;the fans, officials and players of United in their celebrations.&nbsp;The game continued as if nothing had happened.The keeper of Maximum Force, Terrance Lutendo, denied United a sure goal six minutes afterwards. This after Rinae Madzhuta had tried his luck from the edge of the box with a ground cutter. Lutendo braved the shot and executed a brilliant save.United were the first to effect change to their starting line-up. They introduced Lindelani Mbedzi and sacrificed Ndivho Nevari in the 29th minute. Maximum Force threatened to score in the 38th minute. They were awarded a free kick&nbsp;in the 35-meter area. Their centre back, Rendani Masindi, caused disappointment&nbsp;by shooting straight to the keeper.United missed two obvious chances in the opening minutes of the last half. Dakalo Matombo broke loose from&nbsp;the right corner and shot aimlessly from close range. The ball went far wide. Thivhulawi &ldquo;Podoski&rdquo; Silima committed a similar blunder moments thereafter. He shot wide from inside the box, much to the fans&rsquo; disappointment.
