Black Leopards narrowed their chances of gaining automatic promotion to the Absa Premiership Division at the end of the season, when they unexpectedly lost 1-2 to Real Kings in their NFD match at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday.The game was characterized by dangerous tackles. This was mainly influenced by the referee, Lebohang Daniels, who allowed all the evil-doers to go unpunished.The visitors from Durban played defensive football in the first 20 minutes of the game. Realizing that there was nothing to fear, Real Kings took the game to the home side towards the end of the first half. That forced the Leopards&rsquo; technical staff to replace their left back, Andiswa Ndawonde, with Thabang Selowa in the opening minutes of the last stanza.Black Leopards took the lead in the 54th minute. They were awarded a free kick at the edge of the box. Phathutshedzo Nange headed home after a free kick that was taken by Leonard Ntshangase. The referee&rsquo;s handling of the important match caused aggression among the home team&rsquo;s fans, when he denied Lidoda Duvha two clear penalties within a short space of time.In the first instance Mwape Musonda was brought down within the box in the 64th minute. Instead of blowing the whistle, the referee waved a play-on signal, much to the fans&rsquo; disappointment. As if that was not enough to irritate the Leopards&rsquo; fans, Leonard Ntshangase was also brought down within the box moments thereafter. The referee did the unexpected and warned Ntshangase with a card for assimilation.Real Kings scored their two goals within the last ten minutes of the game. Thobani Kunene scored the equalizer in the 80th minute. Bongani Mtshali was on the target with a header four minutes later.
