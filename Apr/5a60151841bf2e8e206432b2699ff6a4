The Department of Education in Limpopo has been alerted about a scam involving unemployed teachers.According to the spokesperson of the Department of Education, Dr Naledzani Rasila, they are aware that scammers, acting as district human resource officials, phone principals and dupe them into giving them the names of shortlisted candidates for vacant posts. They then phone these candidates and promise them permanent employment if they deposit an amount of money.Rasila further said that principals should refrain from giving school information to unauthorised and unknown individuals, as the information they give may be used for such purposes. &ldquo;They are further urged to report the details of the call to the circuit offices and the district to also involve law enforcement agencies,&rdquo; Rasila concluded.
