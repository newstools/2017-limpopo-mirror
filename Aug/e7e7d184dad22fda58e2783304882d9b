The family of Ms Suzan Mabala (30) of Phadzima, who went missing in March, is still waiting for DNA results to establish if a decomposed body found in May is hers.For almost four months now the family has been waiting for DNA test results that will confirm whether it is her body or not. During a recent meeting of different structures at Vhulaudzi to discuss the mystery around Suzan&rsquo;s death, community members demanded that the results of the post mortem in the case be made public, &ldquo;since&nbsp;killing is a public problem&rdquo;.Suzan went missing after allegedly receiving a call from the father of her child, who wanted to meet her outside the home. She was never seen again and her disappearance left turmoil in the village, after angry residents went on the rampage by burning the local Vhulaudzi Satellite police station and two police vans. Suzan&rsquo;s father, Mr Khathutshelo Mabala, said&nbsp;that they wanted to bury his daughter&#39;s remains&nbsp;and forget what had happened, but the police were delaying the process&nbsp;with the lack of results. They wanted to know when they would be able to bury his daughter, he said.He said that they were relieved when the body was found. &ldquo;We hoped it would bring closure to the trauma we are facing. But it&rsquo;s been a long time now since my daughter&rsquo;s body has been lying in the mortuary.&rdquo;Community members, who commented on condition of anonymity, said that the forensic department should be the one conducting the post mortem and not a private general practitioner, like what is happening&nbsp;at the Siloam SAPS.Thohoyandou&nbsp;police&nbsp;station&nbsp;commissioner&nbsp;Brig Willy&nbsp;Mashaba said the police were seriously concerned about the ongoing ritual murder cases in the Vhembe District. &ldquo;We need people to speak out and to reveal information that can lead to the arrest of the perpetrators. Some of these people we know; some of them might be your neighbours or members of your families. I urge you to come forward with the information.&rdquo;
