For months now, Indian businesspeople under the umbrella of the Venda Muslim Jamaat in Vhembe are taking a bold stand in the fight against poverty, hunger and underdevelopment in the rural communities.Each month, the group visits an identified community where they hand over groceries that include mielie meal and other basic stuff that could sustain a family for a month. Since they started, they have visited seven villages and more than 700 disadvantaged families have benefitted.Last weekend, the group received a warm welcome when they arrived at the Malavuwe royal palace, where 140 beneficiaries received food parcels. The local drop-in centre also benefitted. The elderly were&nbsp;not left out as they were also given walking sticks.The group was welcomed by Chief Thusalushaka Mafenya Mphaphuli, who was all praises for the support they were giving his subjects. &quot;We are a very poor community with many families being child-headed and so many of my people not working. We regard this as a blessing, because we have projects here like the giant banana project at Ha-Natsika, but these projects cannot absorb all the unemployed.&rdquo;He added that the groceries would change their lives for the better &quot;and our call is that more and more good Samaritans come our way and help our people.&quot;On behalf of the businesspeople, Mr Vaheed Patel said they knew the economic situation in the country, where many could not make ends meet. He said God blessed them in order that they pass on the blessings by helping the needy.&ldquo;Our long-term plan is to assist the community in starting their own self-sustainable small businesses, such as car washes and spaza shops, that would make them independent, on top of the groceries we give them,&quot; he said.
