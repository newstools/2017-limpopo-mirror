&quot;She was in an abusive relationship and she decided to terminate it. She was, however, killed for taking this bold step.&quot;These were the chilling words from the deceased&rsquo;s older sister, Tsumbedzo Raliphada, when she addressed mourners during the burial of Glenda Radzilani at Madombidzha village on Sunday morning.Tsumbedzo gave a disturbing, heart-wrenching testimony of the alleged abuse of Glenda by her 25-year-old boyfriend, Tshimangadzo Rasiluma, which continued for several years.&nbsp;&ldquo;He had beaten her many times before, and she even sought a protection order against him, but she always forgave him,&rdquo; Tsumbedzo said. &ldquo;My sister had a golden heart and she was surely killed for being good.&rdquo;The 22-year-old Glenda was brutally killed on 31 July inside her bedroom at her home. Rasiluma allegedly confronted her while she wanted to board a bus to work, and dragged her back to her home. &ldquo;He slapped her, used all kindds of crockery&nbsp;to smash her face and head, and stabbed her many times in the face, breasts and other areas of her body,&rdquo; Tsumbedzo told the mourners, who also wept. &ldquo;There are a lot of stories about my sister&rsquo;s death out there, and those stories form part of a big lie.&rdquo;During the memorial service on Saturday evening, different organisations and speakers paid homage to Glenda&rsquo;s memory and warned women to walk out of abusive relationships. Munna Ndi Nnyi&rsquo;s Bardwell Mufunwaini said that what the suspect had done was to put the name of all men to shame. &ldquo;He muddied our name as men,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Men are not cruel &ndash; there are good, loving fathers out there, who take good care of their wives and children.&rdquo;Rinae Sengani Foundation&rsquo;s Rinae Sengani and the Vhembe Pastors Forum&rsquo;s Pastor TP Ramahala said the organisations would march to court and hand in a memo stating that the suspect should be denied bail. &ldquo;We urge all residents here in Vhembe to stand together and fight abuse,&rdquo; Rinae said. &ldquo;We want to believe that people here in Madombidzha saw the suspect dragging Glenda. They heard her cries&nbsp;for help, but what did you do to help her?&rdquo;Glenda&rsquo;s friend, Mpho Mutepe, described the deceased as a person who was full of love, respect and life. &ldquo;I am left with nobody to confide in,&rdquo; she wept.The deceased had a four-year-old son with the suspect. Rasiluma will appear in the Tshilwavhusiku Magistrate&rsquo;s Court on 14 August.
