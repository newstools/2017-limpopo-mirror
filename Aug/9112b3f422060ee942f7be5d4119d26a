The good old days of the Thohoyandou Show, started by the late Khosikhulu Patrick Mphephu, might be gone and&nbsp;forgotten.The Thulamela Municipality, however, is on its way to reviving&nbsp;the once-popular event by hosting its very first show at the Makhuvha Stadium from 31 August to 2 September.According to the acting communications manager, Mr Thiathu Ravhura, the show aims to empower&nbsp;local small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMES) by providing a platform and opportunity to showcase their work and products to the rest of the district.Ravhura said that the three-day show would also put together local business entrepreneurs, arts and crafts, cultural groups and the government in one place for the duration of the show. &quot;Preparations are almost complete and we have a variety of entertainment for all, including a beauty contest and a music festival where local artist will showcase their talents.&nbsp;Various career opportunities for young people will also be exhibited,&quot; said Ravhura.He said the line-up of artists would please all those who were starved for entertainment. As part of the festivities, Thulamela Mayor Mushoni Tshifhango hosted a gala dinner where he acknowledged residents of Thulamela for their contribution towards the development and well-being of the municipality.&quot;I have instructed that the show should not take place if local artists are not part of the proceedings. This is to show how serious we are about empowering our local artists and businesses,&quot; said Tshifhango.
