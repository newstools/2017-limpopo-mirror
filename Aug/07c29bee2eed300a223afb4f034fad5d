Vhembe District used to be a safe place, but when one looks at all the police reports&nbsp;these days it has turned into a treacherous place characterised by killings and violence. To fight against killings and&nbsp;violence, a young and zealous woman, Rinae Singane, recently started the Rinae Sengani Foundation. She told Limpopo Mirror that the foundation was started in May this year. &quot;Due to so many killings in the Vhembe District, domestic violence and kidnappings, I decided to start the Rinae Sengani Foundation to fight&nbsp;the killing of women at home or for rituals, as well as violence and kidnappings,&quot; she added. She further mentioned that the foundation&#39;s aim was&nbsp;to prevent future &quot;domestic violence and killings in Vhembe District.&quot; The foundation is based in Thohoyandou and Ekurhuleni, Johannesburg.&nbsp;She said that some private companies assisted them with funding for the campaigns that they had run so far. &quot;Funding is our biggest challenge. We need assistance from the government and partnerships,&quot; she added. According to her, the foundation helped woman and children who had&nbsp;been or were being abused. &quot;We offer them counselling from our professional social workers and support families of the victims in court,&quot; she said. The foundation also does funeral arrangements for bereaved families. &quot;We also host&nbsp;workshops for women where&nbsp;we teach them how to maintain a healthy relationship and how to walk away from an abusive relationship,&quot; she said.&nbsp;&quot;We also work with organisations such as Munna Ndi Nnyi and the Vhembe pastor&#39;s forum in helping&nbsp;people.&quot; The foundation has been supporting several cases, including the family of Portia Rasilabe, a mother of one who was killed a few months ago. Information regarding the foundation is available on social media. People can follow it on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter under the Rinae Sengani Foundation.
