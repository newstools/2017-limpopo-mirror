Premier Stan Mathabatha and Thovhele Midiyavhathu Tshivhase used the funeral of Mr Rodgers Tshivhase, Chief Whip of the Thulamela Municipality, to endorse the name of deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa as the president-to-be of the ANC for the elective conference that will take place in December.&ldquo;We want people to elect candidates who will have responsibilities during the coming ANC elective conference. We hope Cyril Ramaphosa is the only candidate,&rdquo; said Mathabatha.Mathabatha, who was joined by Thovhele Midiyanvhathu Tshivhase, Executive Mayor Florence Radzilani, Thulamela Mayor Avhashoni Tshifhango and Makhado Mayor Shonisani Sinyosi, addressed hundreds of people in the Khalavha Lutheran Church on Saturday.In describing the qualities of Tshivhase, Mathabatha mentioned that if a book on the liberation struggle in the Vhembe region were&nbsp;be published, the name &ldquo;Rodgers Tshivhase &ldquo;would appear in a special chapter. &quot;He was a revolutionary&nbsp;thinker and gallant fighter who had&nbsp;achieved many things, young as&nbsp;he was.&quot;Cllr Tshivhase (46), who was also acting chief of Khalavha village outside Thohoyandou, passed away in the Polokwane provincial hospital on Saturday a fortnight ago, after a short illness.&ldquo;The late Cde Rodgers Tshivhase was a servant of the people because he always strived&nbsp;to change the lives of his communities for the better. The people of the Khalavha and Vhembe region&nbsp;should emulate&nbsp;the late Tshivhase,&rdquo; added Mathabatha.Thovhele Midiyanvhathu Tshivhase said that, as the family, they were celebrating the life of Rodgers Tshivhase as he had initiated many projects in his community of Khalavha village. &ldquo;We need to get young people like Rodgers who will work hard and be the servant of the people. He left us with some of his dreams of developing his area that have&nbsp;not yet been achieved, but we accept that&nbsp;it was the will of God,&rdquo; said Tshivhase.Tshivhase also said Cyril Ramaphosa was born and bred in Khalavha village and people must honour him by voting for him during the elective conference in December. Thulamela Mayor Tshifhango said that, as the municipality, they were still waiting for good things that&nbsp;Tshivhase could do to enhance the municipality.&nbsp;He said it would be very difficult for the municipality to fill the gap left by this visionary Chief Whip of the municipality.
