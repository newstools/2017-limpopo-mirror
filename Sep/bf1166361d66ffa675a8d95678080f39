Music Well-known reggae artist Khakhathi Tshisikule, aka Khakhathi & Friends, will celebrate his 45th birthday in style by launching his new album at Masana Resort, Nzhelele. The event will be held on 7 October. It will be the 12th album of his career, which started in 2000. The album is called Tshikalane Manyelise. Among other things, this 14-track album is about the current generation, which Khakhathi thinks is doomed. "The current generation does not listen or respect their parents. I am talking about both parents and home and at schools.” He added that he was concerned because the children took life very simply and easily. “It is surprising that they dream of a better future as they don't have morals and value.” He added that if the value of culture and traditions was low, the younger generation could not expect to have success. “Our kids don't respect or listen to anybody, and unfortunately nature will deal with them in a harsh way,” said Tshisikule. Tshisikule said he was also worried that today's generation was not capable of leading the country, which would force them to be led by foreign nationals. Some of the artists who will perform during the event include Racha Kill, Mizo Philly, Corner Stone, Bamba, Zozo, Colbert Mukwevho, Cairo, Manyisa, Shufflers, Bundu, Black Jah, Palesa, Mutendas, Mulanga Musetha (the poet), Tiani Glowe, Prifix, Chabuse, Mazwale, Jimmy, Malondolo, Burning Doctor, Replay Dance Crew, Ramagwedzha and Vanesa.
