The Vhembe Civil Society Network (VCSN), together with the Thohoyandou Victim Empowerment Programme (TVEP), recently held a Women&rsquo;s Day celebration to support and encourage women to recognise that they are important.The event took place at the council chamber of the Vhembe District Municipality.&ldquo;VCSN was formed based on the high rate of unacceptable behaviour towards women and children abuse in the Vhembe area,&rdquo; said the chairperson of the network, Mr Norman Mudau. &ldquo;The act of women and childrenhas become the main problem in Vhembe, and within this year, we have lost a number&nbsp;of our mothers and sisters who were killed by their partners,&rdquo; he added.He advised young girls not to give up on their dreams. &ldquo;Your family background shouldn&rsquo;t give you permission to go and sleep around with blessers. The future is in your hands. Do not destroy it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;He further encouraged women and children to act and break the silence in order to reduce the unacceptable behaviour towards women and children. &ldquo;There are a number of women who are involved in&nbsp;abusive relationships, but they don&rsquo;t speak out. Our organisation is here to help you to overcome the abusive relationships,&rdquo; he said.During the event, some of the women and children shared the&nbsp;heart-breaking stories that they had&nbsp;encountered in their families.
