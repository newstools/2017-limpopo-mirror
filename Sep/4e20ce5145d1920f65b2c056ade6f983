Since the weekend, residents might have seen teams of men busy clearing the bushes along Stubbs Street in Louis Trichardt.These men are all parolees scheduled for release soon. They form part of the Makhado-, Tshilwavhusiku-, Dzanani-, Waterval-, Musina-, Botlokwa- and Tiyani Community Correctional Centre&rsquo;s social re-integration programme. The programme also forms part of the Soutpansberg Chamber of Commerce&rsquo;s ongoing clean-up campaign in town and in Louis Trichardt&#39;s green belt area along the N1. The campaign is a collaboration between the chamber, the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve (VBR), Limpopo Dairy, and the University of Venda&rsquo;s SARCHI Chair on Biodiversity Value and Change in the VBR are at present collaborating with the Makhado Municipality, as well as the extended public works programme and&nbsp;Working on Fire and Working for Water, to clean up the bird and tree sanctuaries to create a haven and recreational space for the community. The above-mentioned correctional centres bought into the idea and are supporting the initiative.A lot of help is, however, still needed.
