Residents of Tshikuwi and surrounding villages, the SAPS and other community stakeholders were vocal&nbsp;about the abuse of women in today&#39;s society.In an event that was organised by the members of the Ramalamula Community Policing Forum, attached to the Mphephu SAPS, the residents sang in one voice, saying that the abuse of women was unacceptable.The chairperson of the Ramalamula Community Policing Forum, Ms Tshiwela Tshihuwa, stated that they had organised the event because they wanted women to interact with men and youths regarding issues of crime. &ldquo;We don&#39;t see our men and youths as our enemies and it&#39;s the reason why there are men and youths at&nbsp;this event,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It breaks our hearts when we read in newspapers about the violence that men and some youths commit and we want to tell them to stop that. We all need to get up to eradicate crime and poverty.&rdquo;Tshihuwa is a community builder and youth developer who leads several youth-related projects in her community. She has more than 300 youths who all come to her for advice and guidance. &ldquo;If we need to restore morals in our communities for a lifelong commitment to good values, we must not exclude the youth,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Cultural activities like tshigombela, malende and drama keep our children off the harsh streets of crime and other forms of violence.&rdquo;The 82-year-old Molatelo Bale, a resident of Tshikuwi village, condemned all evil deeds being done by the youth. She said that there were no violent crimes that are so prevalent today&nbsp;when she was growing up.&nbsp;&ldquo;We understand that times have changed, but we tell all our grandchildren and great-grandchildren to live responsibly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why must we wage war among ourselves? Children need to respect elders because a society without respect for the&nbsp;elders will not be a sober one.&rdquo;Mphephu SAPS&#39;s Capt Aifheli Ranuli said that the event was an eye-opener for those who managed to be present. &ldquo;We as police&nbsp;work hand in glove with our communities and we are also happy to see&nbsp;that all women and men who are involved in our community policing forum always strive to restore ladies&#39; dignity,&rdquo; he said.
