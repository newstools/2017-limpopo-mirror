&ldquo;When bigger institutions like the district municipality tap prolific human resources from us, it is a clear indication that we are doing well in terms of staff empowerment and development.&rdquo;These were the words of Musina Municipal Manager Nathi Tshiwanammbi. He was addressing workers who had converged at the municipal offices on Tuesday to bid farewell to two managers who are leaving Musina to join the Vhembe District Municipality.Mr Mpho Mudau, who served Musina Municipality as local economic development manager for the past four years, has been appointed risk manager at the district level. On the other hand, the senior manager in the technical department of Musina, Ms Chuene Dinyake, is taking up a position as chief technician of project management in Vhembe.Tshiwanammbi said although the municipality still had&nbsp;a challenge in terms of manpower, it would not be proper to stand in employees&rsquo; ways if they wanted to go to greener pastures somewhere else. &ldquo;I always tell people that if opportunities come, they must grasp them with both hands.&rdquo;
