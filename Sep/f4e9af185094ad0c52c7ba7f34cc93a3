&ldquo;We need to take it upon ourselves to make our lives better, because there is no one who will fight for us,&rdquo; said Ms Shalati Chabalala. She was speaking during a recent Women&rsquo;s Month celebratory event held at Avocavale Country Hotel.The function was attended by women from the SANDF, South African Custodian Management (SACM) and the Makhado Air Force Base.Chabalala said in an interview with&nbsp;Limpopo Mirror&nbsp;that women must also take responsibility for cases of domestic violence. &ldquo;Abused women are also assisting their abusers to abuse them, because they depend on them. Woman must be independent,&rdquo; said Chabalala. &ldquo;Self-reliance is very important. When a man realises that you depend on him, he eventually does whatever he wants,&rdquo; she said. Chabalala said that their programme of action would be focusing on aspects such as empowering women economically.Ms Dessirae Moodley, Private Banking Manager of Louis Trichardt Standard Bank, said that part of the programme of action for Women&rsquo;s Month would be to encourage women to pursue education as well as inform them on how they could actively and constructively participate in the Black Economic Empowerment concept.&ldquo;In all our regions, we will be telling women to grab the huge opportunities available to them in various programmes of the government. Doors are now open for all women to compete with men. In the past, men were regarded as the ones determining the boundaries. This is their (women&rsquo;s) month to celebrate their womanhood and in that regard we want to urge men to give women the necessary support they deserve,&rdquo; she said.Ms Matamela Rasikhanya of the SANDF said that her theme was self-empowerment, self-respect and women&rsquo;s rights in the household and marriage. &ldquo;It is crucial that we celebrate the significant roles played by women as mothers and sisters as they have been oppressed for generations,&rdquo; Rasikhanya said.
