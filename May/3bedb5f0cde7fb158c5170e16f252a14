He said that they would make sure that they won their first match at home, in order to boost the players&rsquo; morale.Loscuito said the fact that the first match would be played in two weeks&rsquo; time was a blessing in disguise to them, as it would give their diminutive striker, Siphelele Mkhulise, enough time to recover. Mkhulise was taken off the pitch on a&nbsp;stretcher in their game against Mthatha Bucks at the Thohoyandou Stadium last Sunday.The team that will finish the promotional playoff matches on top of the three-team log will be promoted to the Absa Premiership Division.
