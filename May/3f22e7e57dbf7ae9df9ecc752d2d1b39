Music A young gospel artist from Makonde village, Tsiko Malindi, has reached new heights. He is a zealous musician and there is no stopping him. Malindi, also known as Tsiko Mal (24), is overjoyed to see his dream come true. He has just launched his second album, Goodness and Mercy, during an event at Christ Worship Centre in Maniini. According to him, the album carries a message of hope and salvation and is comprised of 14 tracks, including Follow Me, Hutshe Na Fulufhelo, Ngwana Ya Mudzimu and Uya Ri Awedza. He collaborates with some well-known artists such as Phuluso Thenga and Tiyani Maluleke. Hutshe Na Fulufhelo is a song which aims to restore hope to the people. “The song says there is still hope for those who trust in the Lord, because He is never too late. The songs speak to the inner being and restore strength to those who are giving up,” he added. He said that he started singing when he was still young. “My mother inspired my love for music. I started to sing at Sunday school when I was seven years old,” he added. “Gospel music has been part of my life, because I was born in a Christian family and my uncle is a pastor. Gospel music takes us closer to our Creator and when we are closer to Him, He refreshes our souls,” he said. He asked the community for support and to buy the album. “People should stop pirating our music. We work hard on the albums. Piracy is killing our business,” he added. The new album was produced by Vhutu vbeats Mudau and was recorded at Winman Studios. It was engineered and arranged by Emmanuel Mamphogoro. Malindi can be phoned on 071 623 4297.
