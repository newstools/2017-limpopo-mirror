Pupils at Khwevha Secondary School outside Thohoyandou were told to desist from taking joyrides in taxis, using their parents&rsquo; hard-earned cash, but to rather focus on their studies.Speaking during a visit to the school on Monday morning, Thohoyandou police station commissioner&nbsp;Brig Willy Mashaba said it had&nbsp;become&nbsp;fashionable for learners to be seen on weekends, hanging out of taxi windows with bottles of beer in their hands. Mashaba, who is very passionate about issues of education and crime prevention, visits schools from time to time to conduct crime-awareness campaigns or at the request of the schools.Mashaba was accompanied by Thohoyandou sector II commander&nbsp;Capt Makondelela Tshishonga, Capt Takalani Malogwe and the head of visible policing, Col Abel Mashamba. They interacted with learners on issues of crime and their lives. &quot;Learners at most schools have the same issues affecting them that seek&nbsp;to derail them from their main objective of achieving their academic careers,&quot; Mashaba said.According to him, some of the illicit things that disturb the learners are&nbsp;bullying, drug use, vandalism and mob justice. &ldquo;These things can destroy the future of the pupils, and if they are arrested after being involved, they will not get jobs and that will be the end of their future,&rdquo; he said.He further indicated that the programme was bearing fruit; they were getting positive feedback from the schools and, in some instances, principals want them to revisit their schools. School principal&nbsp;Mr Pieter van Heerden thanked the police for their visit to&nbsp;the school. &ldquo;We are a very lucky school.&nbsp;We used to have two or three delinquent learners who went against the school rules, but through the support we are getting from the different structures, things are running smoothly.&rdquo;
