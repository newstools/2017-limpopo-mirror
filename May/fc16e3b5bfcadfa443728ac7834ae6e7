The two ladies involved in a vicious catfight that broke out two weeks ago at the VIP section of the Migeroni Cafe near Thohoyandou both had to face criminal charges.The incident made headlines at the end of April and the video showing the two ladies fighting was circulated to thousands of social-media users. The place where the fight took place resembled a slaughterhouse, with blood all over.The two women, Tshifhiwa Menzo and Tshishongwe Candy Mainganye, were admitted to hospital for treatment after the incident. Initial rumours that one of the ladies had died&nbsp;proved not&nbsp;to be true. According to Captain Takalani Malugwa of the Thohoyandou Police station, both ladies laid charges of assault to cause grievous bodily harm and had to appear in the local magistrate&rsquo;s court.From what could be established, the state did not opt to prosecute Tshishongwe, but the case against Tshifhiwa is still continuing.
