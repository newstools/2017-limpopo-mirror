Mbilwi Secondary School, which has been experiencing a huge water problem for some time, experienced relief when they received two boreholes from former pupils of the school.The school, which has been producing quality results over the years, has an enrolment of 2 255 this year and water had become a major obstacle to teaching and learning.Last Friday, the school&#39;s 1986 and 1996 Grade 12 classes pooled together and presented two boreholes to the school. During the handing-over ceremony, Mr&nbsp;Londolani Rampfumedzi said it was&nbsp;20 years since he had left school, but after a discussion with a former classmate, they decided to help their former school. &quot;This does not mean that we have lots of money, but we are here to give support to the learners and staff. Mbilwi has become a big brand and we should assist in keeping it afloat.&rdquo;School principal&nbsp;Mr Cedric Lidzhade, who was named Limpopo&#39;s best principal in 2016, said that the former learners were a Godsend and an answer to their challenges. &quot;For years, we had a serious problem of water at the school. We still have many needs and if all come on board, learning and teaching would be highly improved at the school,&quot; he said.The school now has three boreholes, including the one donated by Mvula Trust, which is not yet fully operational.
