Thulamela Mayor&nbsp;Mushoni Tshifhango has urged children to spoil their parents while they are still alive and not to organise expensive funerals.He spoke during an event to honour community builders and retired teachers Vhakoma-Vho Mmbengeni Nephawe and Chief Vho Mulindathavha Mphiriseni Nephawe.The event was held at the The Palm Village at Makumeke in the new Lim345 municipality on Saturday.Tshifhango said that it had become fashionable to have expensive funerals when those being buried could not afford any luxuries during their lifetime. He urged the guests to make their parents happy while they were still alive,&nbsp;as directed by the Bible. &quot;The Bible says we should respect our parents and the elderly and we should do this if we are to receive God&#39;s favour. Let us do the best and f&ecirc;te them while they are alive,&quot; he said.He also praised the family for their contribution to development in their area. The couple&#39;s firstborn and only daughter, Ms Fulufhelo Netshifhefhe, said they felt as children they should honour and show love to their parents while they were still alive. &quot;Our parents have lived a very productive life and have impacted positively in many people&#39;s lives. They made a difference in many families, and as children we shall not forget what they have done for us.&rdquo;
