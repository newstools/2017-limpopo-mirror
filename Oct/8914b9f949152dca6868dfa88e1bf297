A popular Muvhango actress, Maumela Mahuwa, who plays Vho-Suzan, has released a single entitled African Thing. This single follows her debut album, which was released earlier this year. Mahuwa takes music lovers through the continent on African Thing with her powerful vocals supported by a well-produced African beat. The song celebrates Africa, being African and the beauty of this continent. “African Thing is about Africa and the beauty of her people,” she said. “The things we do in Africa that make us who we are – culture, tradition and norms.” Those who have listened to her music have described her as a spirited music powerhouse who takes her audience on a musical journey with her deep, husky and Tshivenda vocal dynamic range. The single was produced by her long-time producer, who is known as Dr Frank. Mahuwa débuted the song a fortnight ago on the breakfast TV show, Morning Live on SABC 2. “I am a woman of many colours – a TV host, an actress, public speaker, a preacher and a celebrity MC,” she said. “Music to me means liberation, freedom of expression and it's a universal language as it crosses borders.” When she is not singing and acting, Mahuwa runs an arts school named African Academy of Cinematic Arts at Maboneng in Joburg. She resides at Mohodi ha Manthata and Mamvuka village. She is available on Facebook.
