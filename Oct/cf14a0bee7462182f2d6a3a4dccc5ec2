Tovhowani Solomon Mbengwa (28) finally launched his two books: How to find a perfect partner and No more desert at the Glory Christian Centre at Dzanani. Mbengwa stated that he believed that everyone on the planet had a gift and that it took courage to recognise this. “In this world, people enjoy different things, some enjoy music while others enjoy reading and more,” he said. “That's where my courage started and I believe that God has brought me in this world to do something, and that there is a gift which he has invested in me that will help a lot of people out there.” His gift had him write the two books, get them published and launched. “The hardest part is to recognise one's gift, and once you have done that, you need to focus on developing and shaping that talent for the benefit of yourself and your fellow human beings,” he said. “I am very happy to see people supporting me in such a way that I only thank God.” Those interested in Mbengwa's books can contact him on 082 713 9006.
