Tshandama Try Together booked a place in the next stage of the MTG and PIB KO competition by beating Mbahe Freedom Rebels 2-0 at the Khubvi Benjies grounds on Sunday.Tshandama made their intentions clear from the first whistle. Their vastly experienced left-footed midfielder, Shumani Alilali, was a marvel to watch. Alilali was everywhere, dishing out defence-splitting passes from the middle of the park, while at the same time playing as a full striker. Rebels had their only chance of the first half&nbsp;in the 14th minute when Thingivhone Mphadi tried his luck with a volley from the edge of the box. The keeper of Try Together, Avhapfani Raudzingana, made his presence felt when he braved the shot and palmed the ball away for a corner kick.Tshandama did not lose hope, despite the fact that they squandered two clear scoring chances within a short space of time. In the first instance, Takalani Netsianda, their centre forward, suffered the pain of watching his close-range half volley going wide in the 28th minute. Muthusi Tshihume committed a similar blunder five minutes later.Tshandama finally broke the deadlock nine minutes before the half-time whistle. Takalani Netsianda was on target with a header, following a square pass from Shumani Alilali. Netsianda was warned with a card for a dangerous tackle three minutes into the last half.Tshandama replaced Muthusi Tshihume and Fhatuwani Mulanduli with Khuliso Mafanedza and Kenny Maedza respectively.Tshandama played the last 20 minutes of the game with their hands tied behind their backs. Takalani Netsianda was given his marching orders, following a second bookable offence. That did not stop them from scoring their second goal. A substitute, Khuliso Mafanedza, forced his way through the defence of Freedom Rebels and beat the keeper with a ground cutter.
