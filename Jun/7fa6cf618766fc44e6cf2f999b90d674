Black Leopards are leaving no stone unturned in their preparations for their first promotional playoff match against Stellenbosch FC, which will be staged at the Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow afternoon. It will be the second promotional playoff fixture for Stellenbosch after hosting Baroka FC at the Athlone Stadium in Cape Town on Wednesday afternoon. Lidoda Duvha have a score to settle with the Cape Town side. Leopards lost 2-3 to Stellenbosch FC in their first-round league match at the Thohoyandou Stadium eight months ago. What pained the Leopards’ fans most in that game was the fact that the Thohoyandou side were leading 2-0 at one stage. Their second-round league match, which was played at the Parow Park Stadium, ended with a 2-1 victory for Stellenbosch. According to the team’s head coach, Mr Jeff Loscuito, his team is ready to absorb the heat that comes with the promotional playoffs. He said that all the players were injury-free. The good news for Black Leopards is that their key players, Phathutshedzo Nange and Lebohang Mabotja, will be available for selection tomorrow. They watched the team’s final league game against Mthatha Bucks from the grandstand while serving a suspension for receiving four yellow cards in the previous matches. Black Leopards will travel to Polokwane next Wednesday, 7 June, for their second fixture against Baroka FC at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. Leopards’ last two fixtures will be against Stellenbosch FC at the Athlone Stadium on Wednesday, 14 June, and Baroka FC at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday, 17 June.
