The MMK Administrators Soccer League game between Ngwenani Young Chiefs and Mbilwi New Generation at the Ngwenani grounds on Saturday was not played to the finish. New Generation were leading 1-0 when the referee unexpectedly blew the final whistle. The visitors from Mbilwi approached the game aggressively, giving the opposition's defenders no time to breathe. Although they were in full control of the game, Generation were the first to effect change to their starting line-up. They introduced Rotondwa Mukhavhuli and sacrificed Thivhusiwi Muvhuso 14 minutes into the game. Generations threatened to score in the 18th minute after Nthangeni Makungo received a neat pass from Takalani Dzivhani and unleashed from just outside the penalty box. The ball missed the target by inches, disappointing the fans who were already celebrating. The visitors did not stop fighting, despite the disappointment. They continued to fight as a collective, creating some dangerous moves from behind. They finally opened their account in the 34th minute. Takalani “Adibayo” Dzivhani beat the offside trap and sent the keeper the wrong way. The goal was a wake-up call to the home side. They effected two changes to their original squad in quick succession. Mbilwi later replaced Nkhumbuleni Razwimisani, who made way for his brother, Funanani. The teams went for the half time break without any sign that the game would be abandoned.  An argument ensued between the referee, Mr Ronewa Managa, and the officials of Young Chiefs shortly before the second half kicked off over the referee’s travelling fee. The officials argued that the match official was not entitled to get a full travelling fee of R200 per team, since he did not have any assistant referee with him. They insisted that he should take the R100 which they offered him. Realizing that the officials were not willing to move an inch from their stance, Managa blew the final whistle, packed his bags and left the place.
