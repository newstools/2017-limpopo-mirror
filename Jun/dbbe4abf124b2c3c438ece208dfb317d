(See a match report on the main sports page).Ramunenyiwa said that when Losciuto was questioned about his sudden request for an urgent meeting with the chairman, he told them that he was intending to resign as the team&rsquo;s coach with immediate effect. According to Ramunenyiwa, the coach was advised to follow the correct channels as stipulated in his employment contract.Ramunenyiwa said that Losciuto should have brought his request in writing. When asked whether they were ready release him if he brought the request in black and white, Ramunenyiwa said that they would decide on the matter upon receipt of the resignation letter from the Belgian mentor.Ramunenyiwa further stated that keeping Losciuto as the team&rsquo;s coach after receiving his resignation letter, because of contractual obligations, would amount to &ldquo;forced marriage&rdquo;. According to Mr Ramunenyiwa, the coach is still contracted to the club for the next 24 months.All efforts made to get Mr Losciuto&rsquo;s side of the story blew a blank as his phone was always on voice mail.Mr Ramunenyiwa expressed his gratitude to the supporters for the&nbsp;unwavering support they demonstrated throughout the past season. &ldquo;The supporters were behind the team, even at times when their performance was below par,&rdquo; he said. According to him, the team will start with the preparations for the new season on Monday, 10 July.
