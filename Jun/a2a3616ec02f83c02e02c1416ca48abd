While other MMK Administrators League teams fought hard to earn their league points last weekend, the situation was totally different for Makovha All Stars. They waited in vain for the arrival of Tshivhulana Real Aces at the Makovha grounds on Sunday afternoon. Seeing that Real Aces were nowhere to be seen inside the field of play at the scheduled 15:00 kick-off time, the referee blew the final whistle, declaring a walkover for All Stars. United Artists scored four goals in their game against Langutani Blue Birds at the Shitlelani grounds. Muziafera Blue Eagles wrapped up their league programme with a bang. They beat Dididi Manguvhewa 4-2 at the Tshitungulwane grounds. Sidou Peace Makers made no peace with Budeli United, whom they narrowly beat 2-1. Obert Ministry Fighters suffered a 1-4 defeat at the hands of Matsakali Sky Rangers, while Shayandima Disco Five collected full points at the expense of Beuster Mighty Chiefs, whom they beat 3-1. Voweto Maximum Force beat Tshakhuma Na Ndilani FC 3-0 at the Zwavhavhili grounds.
