The lifeless body of a young man was found near the Vhafamadi High School in Mashau on Saturday morning.Community members walking along the street made the gruesome discovery early in the morning. The man had gaping wounds to&nbsp;the head, suggesting that he might have been hit with sharp objects before he died. He was later identified as Tendani Sihongo (25) of Ha-Mashau Misevhe B.The mother of deceased, Ms Tshimagadzo Sihongo, said that she had heard that a male person was lying dead in the street, but she was not sure if it was her son. She immediately rushed to the scene.&ldquo;We found a large group of people standing around,&rdquo; she said. When she could get close enough to see, she realised that it was her son. &ldquo;If the people who did this wanted money, they should have taken such from him and left him alone. It&rsquo;s painful;&nbsp;my son wasn&rsquo;t ill. Those responsible for my son&rsquo;s killing will pay for it one of these days. God will answer me,&rdquo; she said.The spokesperson for the SAPS, Col Ngoatshe Ngoepe, confirmed the incident and asked community members who may know something&nbsp;to contact the police. &ldquo;We have opened an inquest docket and we are waiting for the post mortem results,&rdquo; he said.Tendani will be buried tomorrow (Saturday) at Ha-Mashau Misevhe B.
