A referee was allegedly assaulted during a Makhado Local Football Association match at Sheshe on Sunday. The match between Sheshe Bush Bucks and Siloam XI Bullets was abandoned in the second half. Siloam were leading by 1-0 at that stage. Angry fans of Sheshe accused the match official, Mr Nditsheni Mafhala, of being biased. He was rescued by the management of Bullets from a mob of angry fans. Mafhala told Limpopo Mirror that he no longer felt safe and every decision he took was being questioned by angry fans, who threatened to beat him. According to Bullets’ coach, Mr Mpho Luthaga, he is disappointed in the behaviour of Sheshe as “they lack discipline and such behaviour will not get them anywhere.” The marketing manager of Sheshe, Mr George Ndou,  said the referee had failed to control the game from the beginning and his decisions had been one-sided.
