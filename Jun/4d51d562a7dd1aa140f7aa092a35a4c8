Luphephe FC will not take part in the next round of the MTG and PIB KO Competition. They were booted out by Lukalo Hotspurs 3-1 at the Khubvi Benjies grounds on Sunday. As if they were going to bury their opponents alive, Luphephe found the net within 10 minutes of play. Their dribbling wizard, Thabelo Tshisevhe, caught the Hotspurs’ keeper, Nyiko Makondo, napping with a long-range half volley. Luphephe lost their original fighting spirit with time. Hotspurs pressed hard in their search for the equalizer. Luphephe managed to absorb the pressure from Hotspurs until the proceedings for the first half came to an end. Luphephe committed suicide by playing defensive football in the last half. Hotspurs strengthened their midfield by introducing Rudzani Maringa for Hlulani Chauke in the opening minutes of the last stanza. The replacement proved to be a clever move on the part of the technical staff as they managed to find the equalizer soon afterwards. Maluta Munyai broke loose from the right corner and beat the keeper with a half volley. The captain of Luphephe, Rendani Tshisevhe, found himself on the wrong side of the football laws in the 64th minute. He tackled Shonisani Mapholi from behind and he was lucky not to see red. Hotspurs took the lead in the 69th minute. Hlahla Maringa was on target with a ground cutter, following a beautiful pass from Percy Makhubele. Luphephe looked hopeless in the last 10 minutes of the game. That gave Hotspurs a good chance to score their third goal in the 84th minute. Shonisani Mapholi forced his way through the defence of Luphephe and blasted in a rocket from close range. Hotspurs entertained the fans with their dribbling skills in the last five minutes of the game.
