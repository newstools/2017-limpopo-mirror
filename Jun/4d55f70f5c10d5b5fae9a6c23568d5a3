As the youth across the country recently celebrated Youth Day, Mr Nnditsheni Sadiki (31) and his friend, Mr Solomon Malehase (43), &nbsp;celebrated&nbsp;youth month already with the elderly people in their villageNnditsheni from Ha-Mulima Pfananani village said he had come to realize that even the elderly had played a huge part in the 1976 struggle and that they were sometimes forgotten. &nbsp;Almost all the elderly in the village attended the appreciation ceremony, where they were also guided on which route they should take if they experienced domestic abuse.&quot;This ceremony is just an appreciation for the role they played in our lives. We know they were there supporting the struggle by the youth of 1976. To me they are all my parents.&nbsp;They groomed us, so I think their good role must be appreciated. I know that when you appreciate your parents your days of living are being added,&quot; said Sadiki, an evangelist at the Grace Ministry.One elderly citizen, Mr Johannes Matloga (65), who operates the community water pump in the village, was also honoured for the job he&#39;s doing for his community. He said he started working in the village in 1998 and that he felt very encouraged that someone was recognizing the good things they were doing for the community.
