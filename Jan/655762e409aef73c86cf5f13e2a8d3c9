Hardworking staff members at Tshilidzini Hospital received a pat on the back when they were given awards.This was during the hospital&#39;s recent annual service excellence awards that took place at the hospital&#39;s hall, when 25 individuals and 21 teams at the hospital went home with silver, gold and platinum awards.The hospital&#39;s CEO, &nbsp;Mr Mpho Mufamadi, said the hospital had&nbsp;come up with the awards as a way of motivating staff and instilling a sense of competition among all staff members to better services at the hospital.&nbsp;He said&nbsp;said this had paid dividends as there was a great improvement in the dispensation of service and the boosting of morale among staff.The guest speaker, Dr Jibuwo Ndou,&nbsp;said that members of the&nbsp;management of the Department of Health were excited to see the hospital determined to see excellence in practice.&nbsp;&ldquo;Excellence is a habit in an individual, a continuous performance, which is excellent. Let us all emulate and copy the good work by the awardees.&quot;Ms Phathutshedzo Mulaudzi, who won a platinum award as the best administrative clerk, said that she was very motivated.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are very appreciative of the motivation the hospital is doing by introducing such awards.&nbsp;We have a duty as public servants to dispense service to our communities, and we do this not for the awards but as part of our mandate.&quot;&nbsp;
