The South African Football Association (SAFA) is planning to summon the chairman of Black Leopards, Mr David Thidiela, before its disciplinary committee to give answers to charges relating to bringing the association into disrepute.This was confirmed by the association&rsquo;s CEO, Mr Dennis Mumble. According to a fuming Mumble, Thidiela severely criticized the association in a radio interview on 19 December.In the interview, Thidiela is said to have mentioned that the structure that controls the referees at SAFA was incompetent and that the association was not doing anything about that. He further stated that they had sent a letter of complaint to SAFA via the Premier Soccer League after their home game against Mbombela United on 19 November.Thidiela said that their complaint was about the referee who had officiated in that game, whom they accuse of taking decisions that were against them throughout the game. &ldquo;Instead of responding to our complaint, they sent the same referee, Mr Anwar Alexander, to officiate at our game against Royal Eagles at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday, 17 December,&rdquo; said Thidiela.Thidiela was spotted phoning some of the SAFA high-ranking officials before their game against Royal Eagles, sharing his disappointment with the association&rsquo;s decision to send the same referee to their match before they could respond to their letter of complaint. Alexander officiated in the game, despite Thidiela&rsquo;s attempts to have him swapped.Black Leopards beat Royal Eagles 2-1. When asked about further details regarding the matter, Mumble said that the association&rsquo;s legal team was handling the matter and that it would be unethical for him to discuss such a sensitive subject with members of the media.
