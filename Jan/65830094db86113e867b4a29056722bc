A new&nbsp;craze that has taken South Africa by storm is eliciting a lot of criticism, with some people even linking it to acts of Satanism. The craze, driven on social media platforms, requires people to pose as if they are dead. Pictures are then taken and uploaded on the Internet.People have dubbed this craze as satanic, devilish behaviour and strange. In dead-pose images, individuals are seen hanging from fences, trees and rooftops,&nbsp;while others sprawl on the floor with &ldquo;blood-like liquids coming out of their mouths&rdquo; and lying in front of a car as if they had been hit by the&nbsp;vehicle.So far, hashtags such as #DeadPoseChallenge, #DeadPoseChallenge2017 and #DeadPoseWhoKilledIt have&nbsp;been created and they are trending like wildfire.Limpopo Mirror got comments from different persons around the Vhembe district to test the general feelings about #DeadPose.Film maker Murendeni AfreeCa said: &ldquo;There are simple things that distinguish us humans from animals and posing dead is arguably one of them. As humans we have dreams and expectations from our loved ones and when they pass on, we mourn the loss. When death is now being made a joke of, I don&#39;t think it sits well with those who are still in pain from&nbsp;a loss.&rdquo;Rotondwa Musitha, an award-winning model, said: &ldquo;The dead-pose issue is a very sensitive one and sends across an ill-mannered behaviour. I still fail to understand why people are entertaining this pose that only mocks those that have passed on. Death isn&rsquo;t something we play with, it isn&rsquo;t entertainment and as it stands that is what we have turned it out to be.&rdquo;Popular dee jay and singer&nbsp;Shony Mrepa, said: &ldquo;I think dead pose is good and that it&rsquo;s just a fun game on Facebook. I did it myself also. This has nothing to do with tradition; it&rsquo;s just a pose &ndash; and it (the trend) will pass soon.&rdquo;VenRap queen Humblo Humbu Manenzhe: &ldquo;As a black female I was taught to respect death and honour the dead. Having that planted in me from a very tender age, I have always ignored any jokes associated with death. I usually follow social media trends, but the #deadpose I chose to ignore. For me it&rsquo;s culturally and morally wrong, looking at how I was raised. We see sad images of people lying helplessly dead in newspapers daily, and to think people find those positions funny is just not on!&rdquo;Tshidino Ndou: &ldquo;Dead pose is not funny. Posing as if one is dead is against our culture. Besides, dead pose can also scare one&rsquo;s family and friends [into] thinking they are dead for real. Anything can go wrong while dead-posing as some people take the trend too far by posing in risky places such as railway lines, electricity lines, water dams and busy roads.&rdquo;HaaNdi YellowMah said: &ldquo;I don&#39;t see any logic behind the dead pose stuff. It&rsquo;s a trend I condemn as an artist and a human being. Don&rsquo;t play with death.&rdquo;Poet and writer&nbsp;Adorn Keketso&nbsp;said: &ldquo;In my culture, it is a taboo to joke about death. In my opinion there is nothing funny about death, because death is a thief that we grew up knowing. It ought not to be celebrated. I personally will not pose dead and I don&rsquo;t think I will encourage anyone to do it.&rdquo;Makhado FM&#39;s dee jay, Rofhiwa Roxy Munyai, said: &ldquo;For me, I won&rsquo;t do it because it is like wishing myself dead. I fail to understand our generation as they always try anything strange. That&rsquo;s something insane and shameful.&rdquo;
