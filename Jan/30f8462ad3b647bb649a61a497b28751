Residents finding themselves in an emergency should keep their fingers crossed while phoning the Makhado Fire Station for assistance.Since the start of January, the Louis Trichardt-based station has been experiencing technical difficulties with its telephone lines. Getting hold of their control room is virtually impossible. The newspaper has tried several times over the last two weeks - without success.It was only after asking around that it came to light that the telephone lines have not been functioning properly for the last month.The spokesperson for the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM), Mr Matodzi Ralushai, confirmed this week that there is currently no way of getting hold of the station. The only landline that works (some of the time) is 015 516 5588. This number is, however, also experiencing difficulties. &ldquo;We regret the technical challenges experienced by our citizens, but the matter has been reported,&rdquo; said Ralushai. &nbsp;Residents are advised, for the time being, to rather contact the following institutions in case of an emergency:&nbsp;The Makhado Police Station (015 519 4300), the Louis Trichardt Ambulance Services (015 516 4378/2395) or the Soutpansberg Town Watch (082 251 0827).
