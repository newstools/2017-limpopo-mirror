The escalating number of women being abused in Limpopo prompted the young&nbsp;Orifha Rambau of Mashamba Village to establish a movement&nbsp;known as the Female Army.Rambau (21), who is doing a BSc in Life Science at the University of Limpopo, said the movement was focusing on the domestic problems affecting women on a daily basis. &ldquo;We are also attending to problems faced by female learners who are missing school when they have their menstrual cycles&nbsp;because of not having sanitary towels. Girls need all the support possible to stay in school,&rdquo; she said.According to her, the Female Army is there to &ldquo;give a voice to the voiceless&rdquo;. They have adopted 10 schools in the Vhembe District, with 2 053 girls &ldquo;from the poorest of the poor families. We supply sanitary pads every month and offer&nbsp;menstrual education.&rdquo;She added that they had&nbsp;also established a foundation, &ldquo;Do it like a man&rdquo;, and she manages it with Imani Munyai and Lwendo Mulaudzi. She is also the owner Eccentricflame Empire, an events-management company for young people.According to her, all the organisations have the aim to curb poverty in all possible ways. &ldquo;We&nbsp;recently hosted an event that had female bouncers and&nbsp;DJs and the entrance fee was a packet of sanitary pads.&nbsp;After that event, we received a lot of phones calls from people and they are determined to donate more pads&rdquo;.She said that the biggest challenge was that they did not&nbsp;have funds and were financing the sanitary-towel project mostly out of their own pockets.
