Some of the miseries and sorrows that Mudimeli residents have endured for the past 16 years will hopefully soon be a thing of the past. This comes after the Makhado Local Municipality&#39;s mayor, Shonisani Mildred Sinyosi, launched the bridge construction project that will link the area with the main road network.Makhado Municipality has allocated R12 million for the project to reconstruct the bridge that was washed away during the floods of 2000. When the project was launched a fortnight ago, Cllr John Mamafha said that the government had listened to the residents&rsquo; grievances. &ldquo;We are working tirelessly in order to deliver better service to everyone,&rdquo; said Mamafha. He said that, when the construction work was finished, everyone would be able to access social amenities such as the clinic.The mayor encouraged the constructors to employ local people and buy locally. She also urged the contractor to deliver quality work. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve injected millions into this bridge, so we must get a quality bridge,&rdquo; said Sinyosi. She warned residents not to vandalize government property. &ldquo;We do not want to see residents burning tyres on this bridge. Let&rsquo;s respect and protect government property,&quot; added the mayor.A local traditional leader, Chief Radzilani Mudimeli, applauded the good work the mayor is doing for the residents. He added that his people used to struggle to cross the bridge, especially during rainy seasons. &ldquo;I am happy that my people will find it easy to cross the river when the bridge is completed,&rdquo; he said.The contractor that was appointed to oversee the project&nbsp;said that at least 30 temporary jobs would be created when the bridge construction began. He said that the construction work was expected to be finished in July.
