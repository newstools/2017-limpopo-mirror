The traditional leaders of Vuwani and surrounding areas, the Pro-Makhado Task Team and the Limpopo government have agreed that the troubled area will not be serviced in the interim by the new LIM 345 municipality.It was announced during a recent media briefing in Polokwane that residents will get service from the Thulamela and Makhado municipalities.The traditional leaders and Pro-Makhado Task Team are opposed to inclusion in the newly established LIM 345 municipality and will soon make submissions to the Municipal Demarcation Board (MDB), explaining their intention not to be part of the new municipality. In May last year, violence erupted in the area after the demarcation board&#39;s decision to incorporate Vuwani into a new municipality, Lim345. More than 30 schools were either burnt down or vandalised in the protest.Provincial spokesperson&nbsp;Mr Phuti Seloba said that the interministerial committee is currently waiting for consideration of a list of proposed municipal services to be rendered by the two municipalities in the interim, while processes to predetermine municipal boundaries continue.The spokesperson for the Pro-Makhado Task Team, Mr Nsovo Sambo, said they were still getting services from the Makhado Municipality. &ldquo;We have never voted for the leadership of the Lim 345 during the local government elections. We know our father (Makhado Municipality) and forcing us to be under Lim 345 is like worshipping a stepfather.&quot;
