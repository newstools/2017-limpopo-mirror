We will host it here and I will help you with everything you need to make it a success.&rdquo;According to the event organiser, Mr Tshidino Ndou, the festival is aimed at unearthing acting and musical talent in the Vhembe district. He said this exciting festival desired&nbsp;to reach into the deep rural areas and discover young musicians who were trapped by poverty, unemployment and lack of exposure.&ldquo;The festival offers an excellent opportunity for talented youth in the rural communities to have a performance platform,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Ndou told Limpopo Mirror that he was on a mission to give developing talent the chance to network with other artists at all levels and professionals from all over the district, if not the province. He said the festival also aimed&nbsp;to raise awareness through drama and music.Some community drama groups such as Tshilapfene Youth Drama Development, Tshedza Community Drama and Dzhatsha Community Development entertained the audience.Tshidino welcomed Ms&nbsp;Muthambi with a stunning performance of his hit song Munwe na munwe una zwine a tenda khazwo, which made Muthambi put on her dancing shoes. Avhapfani Gabara &amp; The New Toronto Band stole the show by taking the audience on a journey back to the 1980s with their hit song&nbsp;Mbuyavhuhadzi.There were also music performamnces by Zwido, Sikheli Junior, Mavutha, Texas &amp; the African Rhythm, Gwandread, Nditshe Ramalamula, The Prince M, Ravhalusani Ratshitanga, Phumu Gee, Bashy, Ras Mulweli, Mash&rsquo;B, Humbulani Ramagwedzha and Deejay Roneh.Ndou said that he would like to take the festival to other local municipalities in the district since the festival was not only meant for Tshakhuma artists and audiences alone. &ldquo;I started the festival and that only shows that pride begins at home,&rdquo; he said.All community drama groups who are interested in participating in the Good Friday edition of the festival can contact Tshidino Ndou at&nbsp;082 542 4041, tshidino.ndou@gmail.com or tshakhumafestival@gmail.com.
