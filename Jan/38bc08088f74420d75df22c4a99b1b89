Adivhaho Gifty Singo does not have a distinctive posture, but she is a very special, talented person who maximizes her talent to the best of her ability.Singo, who stays at Masisi village outside Musina, sings what is contemporarily known as manyalo music and she has taken her place as the darling of music lovers through her acrobatic dancing skills and sweet voice.Widely known by her stage name of Lady Gee, Singo was born and bred in Masisi in 1997. At first&nbsp;she wanted to become a geologist, but although she is furthering her boilermaking studies at Vhembe TVET, the music bug&nbsp;got into her blood, so that she eats and dreams of music almost every day of her life.Lady Gee said she was introduced to the world of music while she was a learner at Masisi Primary School. &ldquo;My love for music grew bigger when I was doing my high school education at Tshikundamalema Secondary. Realizing that I had&nbsp;a sweet voice, teachers would ask me to lead in songs during the morning devotions and this gave me more courage to nurture my singing talent.&rdquo;Her seven-track debut album, Zwithu zwi nntha, which has sold more than 500 copies since its release in December last year, &nbsp;is quickly penetrating the music industry and lovers of Manyalo music always cry for more whenever she performs. The songs that will automatically get people dancing include the title track, Zwithu zwi ntha, as well as Vhanna, Tanganedza and Matakadzambiluni.&nbsp;She says she was inspired by famous manyalo queen&nbsp;Makhadzi. &ldquo;Her voice and the way she sings made me love manyalo music and I told myself that one day I would also record my music and join her in the music fraternity. I&rsquo;m happy that my dream has now been turned into reality.&rdquo;For bookings, public performances and cd sales, Lady Gee can be contacted on 076 023 4004.&nbsp;&nbsp;
