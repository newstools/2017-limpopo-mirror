In an effort to deliver the promised services to the people, Makhado Mayor Shonisani Sinyosi officially handed over infrastructure projects around the area last week Thursday.According to Sinyosi, the municipality is committed to rendering services. &ldquo;This is not a time for empty promises, but a time to deliver what we have promised.&rdquo; She added that the municipality would continuously deliver quality services.She also said that Makhado Municipality would&nbsp;have fewer gravel roads this year&nbsp;because money was available to upgrade some of the gravel roads to tarred roads. According to her, the municipality has put aside more than R100-million to upgrade gravel roads to tar roads and to finance other facilities.She appealed to residents to refrain from burning tyres in the road. &quot;Let us respect and protect government property, because it is made for you,&quot; she added.The other roads that will be upgraded from gravel to tar are: Piesanghoek to Khunda (phase 3), Tshedza to Vuvha (phase 1), Gombita to Tshivhuyuni (phase 1), Sereni to Mashamba (phase 3), Xicatini to Jiweni, Tshivhulana to Tshilaphala and Tshikwarani to Zamenkoste.All the road-construction projects will take six moths to complete and during the construction, residents will also benefit from temporary employment, Sinyosi said.
