Following his retrenchment from Black Leopards three weeks ago, Thembi Nevhulamba will be in Magezi FC&rsquo;s colours when their activities for the National First Division League resume in two weeks&#39; time.After some lengthy discussions with the Polokwane-based side, the 31-year-old striker finally signed on the dotted line.According to Nevhulamba, the contract he entered with the club will see him play for Magezi for the next six months. He said that he did not want to commit himself to the club for a period exceeding six months, considering the fact that the team is currently languishing at the bottom of the 16-team log. He added that he would negotiate a new contract with the club at the end of the season if the team managed to escape relegation to the lower division.When asked about his plans at Magezi, Nevhulamba said that his aim was to score in every game to enhance his team&rsquo;s chances to escape the relegation axe at the end of the season.Nevhulamba joined Black Leopards from the ABC Motsepe League side, Joe Express FC, at the beginning of last season. His relationship with Lidoda Duvha deteriorated with time until the club decided to offload him three weeks ago.The chief executive officer of Magezi FC, Mr Tshifhiwa Thidiela, confirmed the move, saying they were happy to have&nbsp;a striker of Nevhulamba&rsquo;s calibre in their camp. He said that they would sign two or three more experienced players before the transfer window period closes next Tuesday, 31 January.Magezi will host Witbank Spurs in their opening match&nbsp;at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday, 11 February.
