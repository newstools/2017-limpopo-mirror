The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Limpopo says they are saddened by the fact that the Limpopo Province recorded the highest increase of road fatalities during the festive season with&nbsp;31%, increasing from 186 fatalities in 2015 to 244 in&nbsp;2016.&ldquo;Limpopo has further, together with KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and the Eastern Cape, contributed to a 61% increase in&nbsp;the total number of people who died on the roads during the festive season,&rdquo; states&nbsp;the DA in a press release.According to the DA, the department of transport is running out of ideas on how to curb the carnage. &ldquo;A new approach is needed to save the lives of road users. Roads such as the R37, R81, N1 and R101 have become high-accident&nbsp;zones, despite announcements by the department to increase the number of traffic officers during this period,&rdquo; says&nbsp;the DA.In light of the increase in road fatalities, the DA says&nbsp;that they will write to the Portfolio Committee on Transport to summon MEC Nandi Ndalani to provide a detailed account of the department&rsquo;s resources and to determine whether their current plan is effective and efficient enough to stem the devastating tide of deaths on our roads before the exodus to Moria over the Easter weekend.In the meantime, the DA extends&nbsp;their deepest condolences to the family, friends and loved ones of every person who tragically lost their life on the roads over the past month.&nbsp;
