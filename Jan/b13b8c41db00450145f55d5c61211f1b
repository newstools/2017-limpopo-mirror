&ldquo;The Musina Municipality would like to put it on record that the rumors that the mayor and municipal manager have been suspended are baseless, misleading and untrue.&rdquo;These are the words of the communications manager of the Musina Local Municipality, Mr Wilson Dzebu. He reacted to an inquiry from Limpopo Mirror after several people phoned the paper&rsquo;s offices, requiring clarity regarding the positions of the two municipal officials.Dzebu stated that Cllr Mihloti Muhlope was still the mayor of the local municipality &ldquo;and the council still has confidence in her&rdquo;. He said Mr Johnson Matshivha still occupied&nbsp;the position of municipal manager and accounting officer.According to Dzebu, the rumours &ldquo;are spread by people who want to destabilize the progress and smooth running of the municipality&quot;. He emphasized that nobody would shift the municipality&rsquo;s focus away from delivering efficient services.Dzebu acknowledged, however, that it is true that the municipality owed Eskom around R102 million. &quot;Rumours that Eskom is in the&nbsp;process of disconnecting us are unfounded and false. Council is working on a strategic, comprehensive repayment plan,&quot; he added.
