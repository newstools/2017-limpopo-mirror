When he arrived at the scene, only the heads and intestines remained.Police spokesperson&nbsp;Lt Col Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that there had been an increase in complaints of stock theft in the Hlanganani area.

Some of the farmers identified their cows,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Three months ago, we received another complaint about many stolen cows found slaughtered in the bush in different areas,&rdquo; he said.
