All the winners received bursaries from Avuxeni College.According to one of the organisers, Mr Molatelo Machaba, they had realized that to reduce crime and encourage the youth in education, there was a need to offer prizes of&nbsp;different activities.&nbsp;He further said that they were happy with the outcome of the contest as well as the fact that they had done something for young rural adults. &ldquo;Most of the talented young ladies never received the opportunity to show their talent, especially in modelling.&rdquo;Machaba thanked&nbsp;all the stakeholders who supported them during the contest, adding that they wanted to make it an annual event.The manager of Avuxeni College, Mr Morris Nkuna, said that he had donated bedroom suites, pillow cases, study tables and a free training course to all who participated in the beauty contest.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed every moment of the competition, despite all the challenges that came with it,&rdquo; said the queen, Elelwani Tshidada. She said she would spend this year educating young people of her age about the importance of embracing their beauty.
