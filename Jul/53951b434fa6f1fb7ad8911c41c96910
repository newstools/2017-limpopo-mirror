The Elim hospital doctor who was arrested last week on drug-related charges&nbsp;was also suspended from work while the investigations are continuing.Mpho Paul Lekalakala (35), a clinical doctor attached to the Elim Hospital, appeared briefly in the Waterval Magistrate&rsquo;s court last Thursday.Police reports state that the suspect is currently doing community service around the Waterval area. Nine sachets of nyaope, four rocks (hard drugs), two smoking pipes and a plastic bag containing dagga were confiscated during his arrest.The police spokesperson, Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe, said that Lekalakala&rsquo;s arrest was part of a provincial clampdown on possible drug dealers. He said that the police had tracked the suspect after receiving a tip off. &ldquo;Information was followed up that led the police to a house where the doctor and his alleged accomplice, aged 32, were arrested. These operations will be conducted continuously to rid the affected areas of this scourge,&rdquo; said Ngoepe.The case was postponed to 1 August for further investigations. The doctor was released on bail of R1 000. The other accused opted to pay an admission-of-guilt fine of R300.Lekalakala, who was doing his community service at the Elim Hospital, was apparently on leave at the time of his arrest.The Limpopo Department of Health announced this week that Lekalakala has&nbsp;been suspended. The department&rsquo;s spokesperson, Mr Thabiso Teffo, said that such an act as Lekalakala is being accused of, sought to undermine the government&rsquo;s efforts in the fight against drug abuse. He said the doctor would remain suspended, following the disciplinary procedures instituted by the department. &ldquo;While we subscribe to the notion of innocent until proven guilty, we have served the doctor with immediate suspension to pave the way for internal investigations,&rdquo; he said.
