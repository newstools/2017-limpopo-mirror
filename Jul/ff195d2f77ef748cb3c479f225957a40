The chairperson of&nbsp;the Green Development Foundation, Mr Mulalo Thabela, says it is time that people start setting long-term objectives in terms of caring for and protecting&nbsp;the environment.This was during a recent workshop of the community about greening and environment that was held at Mauluma.Thabela said that it was very effective to raise people&#39;s awareness through demonstrations. &ldquo;That is why we embarked on a practical experience by going all out to clean up the area and plant vegetables and trees.&rdquo; &nbsp;He emphasised that people must make sure that their trash is secured and he advised them to put all their trash in the dustbins and properly seal their garbage containers.According to him, taking care of the environment is part of people&acute;s commitment to being good corporate citizens. &quot;We need to develop a sense of environmental responsibility, which is essential in our everyday life. It is the absence of this responsibility that is causing problems in our streets, residential areas, market places and other public places,&quot; he said.Vhamusanda Vho-Ramaano &quot;Muthu-ha-thomi&quot; Ravele said that women must refrain from throwing baby nappies all over the place&nbsp;because these were&nbsp;polluting the environment.Ravele said it was important to equip community members with knowledge of waste management, recycling and re-use of products. &ldquo;It is also important to note that illegal dumping is a criminal offence that is a very serious health hazard. We encourage our people to refrain from littering because it can badly affect community health.&rdquo;
