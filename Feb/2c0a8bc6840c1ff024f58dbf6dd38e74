One Vhembe woman is&nbsp;living testimony that nothing beats hard work and determination if one wants to live a happier life.An entrepreneur, Livhuwani Nemaungani, better known as Luvhuki in business circles, believes that in order to preserve a business enterprise, one needs to work hard and have a strong, motivated team.&ldquo;The youth out there need&nbsp;to understand that there&rsquo;s no quick formula to help you reach your business goals,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You need to set down your goals and work hard&nbsp;towards achieving those bright goals.&rdquo;This highly-spirited woman owns Livhuki General Trading, a company that deals in, among other ventures, poultry farming and crop production farming. The farm is situated at Ramavhoya village.&ldquo;At the end of the day, one needs to understand that one doesn&rsquo;t run a farming business for the purposes of getting any form of glory,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We do it for our district and our country; we are feeding the nation. It&rsquo;ll only be fair to state that farming is a country&rsquo;s economic cornerstone.&rdquo;They specialise in producing &ndash; among other things &ndash; cabbages, tomatoes, spinach, baby marrow, onion, mustard, beetroot, butternut and green pepper. &ldquo;We purchase seedlings from a nursery, apply compost, plant and fertilise, and maintain the harvest,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;When harvest time comes, we deliver our fresh produce to major supermarkets and fruit-and-vegetable open markets.&rdquo;So far, Livhuki&#39;s challenge is that she has got a huge demand for products, more than she can supply at this stage. &ldquo;Securing more capital only translates into the&nbsp;possibility of creating more jobs for unemployed men and women here in Vhembe district.&rdquo;She reckons farming is a viable venture. &ldquo;However, just like any other field, farming has got technicalities of its own and one needs to know all those in order to produce quality products,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Failure to know and understand the use of certain chemicals to treat plants results in a greater loss. And sometimes there are natural disasters which are part of setbacks in this field.&rdquo;She states, however, that nothing beats a positive spirit. &ldquo;You need to motivate yourself and employees,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I have always learned that in farming we must always have insurance. In cases where natural disasters strike, we&rsquo;ll know that we have something to fall back on.&quot;This mother of two, a 14-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old son, delights in combining business and motherhood.Indeed, hard work has&nbsp;paid off for Livhuki as she has&nbsp;won numerous farmers&rsquo; awards and youth-in-business awards for her farming expertise, and the prizes have served as a motivation for her to work even harder.
