Hundreds of people gathered at the Waterval hall on Saturday to pay their last respects to Gogo Mujaji Manganyi (83), who was buried at the Waterval graveyard.She died a horrific death in the Elim Hospital, when she obtained third-degree burn wounds and passed away after falling in a bath of boiling water. The incident took place on 2 February and after the incident it was reported that a unit manager and a junior nurse at the hospital had&nbsp;been suspended.During the ceremony, Gogo Manganyi was described as a pioneer, a born leader and a woman of vision. She helped everyone, despite her circumstances. &quot;We are saddened by her death, but we will have to accept it as part of God&rsquo;s plan. For many years, she served selflessly and faithfully in parishes throughout the country, and in those dark days she made herself available day and night to all who needed her,&rdquo; several of the speakers emphasised.Family representative Jabu Manganyi thanked friends, family members and the community for supporting them in the difficult time after losing their loved one. &ldquo;We accept humbly that Mujaji is gone, but we are comforted by your presence here today. We might not understand why she died in such a brutal way, but God has all the answers.&nbsp;We love her so dearly and it is comforting to know that she will always be with us in our hearts.&rdquo;Mourners wailed uncontrollably as Pastor Willington Hlungwani read verses from the Bible as the gogo&rsquo;s coffin was lowered into the earth.
