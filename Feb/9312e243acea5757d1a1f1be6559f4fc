Scores of unemployed youths in Vhembe, who have been struggling, could see their fortunes change for the better.This follows a meeting between the University of Venda (Univen) and the Construction Education and Training Authority (CETA), where the latter committed an amount of R10,5 million that will assist 365 Univen students and youths from around Vhembe in a number of programmes. The programmes include bursaries, candidacy, learnerships, internships, apprenticeships and short skills programmes.The meeting was recently held in Polokwane.In handing over the award, CETA board chairperson&nbsp;Mr Raymond Cele emphasized that his board was committed to supporting learners and students, especially those who were academically deserving&nbsp;and from previously disadvantaged backgrounds. &ldquo;The CETA-Univen collaboration is an outstanding project that can be replicated anywhere in this country,&rdquo;&nbsp;he added.Speaking at the event, the chief executive officer of CETA, Ms Sonja Pilusa, commended the university for managing its CETA projects efficiently, thus creating trust for continued collaboration.An excited Prof Peter Mbati, Univen&#39;s principal, thanked CETA for trusting Univen to facilitate and carry out the programmes. He indicated that the success of Univen&rsquo;s transformative agenda was&nbsp;largely dependent on partnerships, such as the one with CETA. He added that his university enrolled&nbsp;many bright students from financially disadvantaged backgrounds&nbsp;who required the support of the public and private sector to flourish in their chosen professional fields.&ldquo;This round of funding will greatly impact on the lives of many of my students and deserving members from our rural communities in Limpopo. You are making a huge difference in the lives of children who couldn&rsquo;t afford tertiary fees and this is commendable,&rdquo; he said.This is not the first time that CETA has joined&nbsp;Univen as it had previously committed R22 million towards the development of a degree programme in construction technology in the School of Environmental Sciences at Univen.The previous funding has resulted in the construction of the CETA Community Skills Development Centre and an engineering laboratory is in the pipeline.
