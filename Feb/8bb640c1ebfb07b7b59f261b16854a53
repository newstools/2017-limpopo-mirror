Are mopane worms, an important part of many a Limpopo resident&rsquo;s diet, going extinct?A master&rsquo;s graduate from the University of Cape Town, James Sekonya, found mopane worms were in serious decline in communities where they are an important food source, a trading commodity and an intrinsic part of cultural practices.Sekonya compiled his research by visiting the villages of Bokmakierie, Matiyani, Ha Gumbu, Masisi, Zwigodini and Mphambo here in our own Vhembe District and also the Nkomo Village in the Mopani District. Additional interviews were conducted with traders at markets in Thohoyandou, Louis Trichardt, Malamulele, Giyani and Elim.His study focused on investigating the contribution of the mopane worm to&nbsp;rural livelihoods, and the effects of environmental change on mopane worm harvesting in rural households. What he found was that the drop in the density of mopane trees, vegetation change, lower-than-normal rainfall and higher-than-normal temperatures were the leading forms of environmental change that had a significant impact on the availability of mopane worms to the communities.&quot;Household consumption and trade patterns were changed with the weather and climatic conditions arising from the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon,&quot; explained Sekonya.These outlined environmental changes are becoming more evident, rendering rural people more vulnerable as it threatens their livelihoods. Apart from being an important source of food, the mopane worm is also a valuable trading commodity. &ldquo;Trading was found to be an important form of employment for rural people who have limited prospects of formal employment, and had the potential to generate higher income levels,&rdquo; said Sekonya.Sekonya was of the opinion that more studies will be needed, in addition to improved cooperation between traditional leaders, harvesters and local government as an option for management of the communal harvesting areas to ensure that mopane worm populations don&rsquo;t dwindle any further. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
