The National Lottery Commission (NLC) came to the rescue of Vhafamadi High School and provided 15 new modern classes to the school.The school was extremely damaged after it was set alight during last year&rsquo;s violent protest in Vuwani against incorporation into a new municipality in the Malamulele area.The violence left about 30 schools totally or partly destroyed by fire, and more than 50 000 learners in the area were affected. Pupils were left stranded when the classes burnt down and the Department of Education provided mobile classrooms.The chairperson of the NLC, Prof Alfred Nevhutanda, said during the recent official opening that the NLC directed&nbsp;its social investment to communities&nbsp;where it could make a real difference and have a positive impact. &quot;Education has been a key focus area of the company&#39;s corporate social investment programme, because they believe that education and youth development are important for the future success of the country.&quot;The MEC for&nbsp;Education, Mr Ishmael Kgetjepe, expressed the hope that other companies or businesspeople would&nbsp;learn from the example of the NLC by donating something that could help the education of the local children. &quot;There is a serious shortage of classrooms in our schools as many of us are in rural areas. We hope more companies will open their hearts to help improve education for our children,&quot; said Kgetjepe.He said the new infrastructure at the school should inspire and encourage both pupils and teachers to do better in their work and to improve the school&#39;s results. &nbsp;He urged pupils to &quot;work like slaves in order to live like kings and queens&quot;&nbsp;in the future.The principal of Vhafamadi High, Mr Mashau Thenga, expressed his joy and happiness when he saw the new classrooms official opened. &ldquo;We are very happy about what is happening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&#39;s no greater joy for parents than witnessing the construction of a new school,&rdquo; he added.
